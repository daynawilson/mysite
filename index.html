        <h3>Web Design & Development</h3>
        <p>I started learning to code by accident when I was starting a blog on Wordpress. Although I was using an excellent template, there were times when I would need to think outside the box to get the page to look the way I wanted. By Googling how-to's, I found neat tricks in the code to fix things. After creating multiple start-up business sites and learning more coding adjustments, I realized I love the coding and design process more than actually running the business.ðŸ˜‚ I finally got smart and decided my true passion and future was in Web Development.</p>

        <h3>Killer Cappuccinos</h3>
        <p>I make an awesome caramel cappuccino with just the right amount of cream and caramel drizzle on top. It helps having a daughter that works at Starbucks. Nothing beats a good break from coding like a perfect cappuccino and some Kdrama time.</p>
